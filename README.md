# Speaker Design Tools. 2.0

This is a project I started as I was dissatisfied with the current tools for developing DIY speaker cabinets in the wild. It quickly turned into an obsession with drawing the product of multiple frequency response plots and the crossover filters combining them.

I have currently shelved this project and am waiting for WebGPU to exist as I am unhappy with the results of this project.
