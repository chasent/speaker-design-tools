TODO: 



Optimizations:
- Use 4k textures instead
- Turn textures into a lookup map
  - Chop up 20 - 20k Hz into evenly spaced groups within the logarithm:
    i.e.  y = (log(x) - log(20)) / 3
          where
            y: 0 -> 1
      average all themeasurements in each group,

      optionally: we could also change the plotter to store data into the texture as
                  y = (m)x + c where we store m and c in each group to avoid computing
                  the gradient at all in the shader

  - Pre-compute 




1.) Make lines a constant size
2.) Draw graph lines
2.) Draw plot numbers at correct locations
3.) Implement filters
4.) Implement Mulitple FRD inputs
5.) Implement combining responses with filters
